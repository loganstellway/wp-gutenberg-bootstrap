## Blocks

**Grid**

Use our powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.

Refer to the [Bootstrap reference](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) for more information.

**Embed**

Create responsive video or slideshow embeds based on the width of the parent by creating an intrinsic ratio that scales on any device.

Refer to the [Bootstrap reference](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/embed/) for more information.

**Button**

Use Bootstrapâ€™s custom button styles for actions in forms, dialogs, and more with support for multiple sizes, states, and more.
